# Closures
Closures implementations with low-level languages

Examples cover implementations of closures using:
 - [x] trampolines in LLVM
 - [ ] fat-pointers in C
 - [x] objects in C
 - [ ] thunks in C
 
I'm not using C++ for objects in this example, because point of this example is to make complexity and overhead visible. 

Future plans for extensions of this example include benchmarks and implementations for reference counted closures.
